Met isabel on the bus. Talked about the origins of ragtime in black american culture.

On the one hand it would be nice to have those plots again.
On the other hand, the most important thing is to know which reads are outliers, and study those.
The best way to do this is to go through the output of some intermediate step of the contrast-gams-pipeline.sh 
and plot all the reads that change on a manhattan-esque plot, with x label being arbitrary "# of read."
Then also print the reads that are most interesting, their graph position, 
and their "numbers" so that we know which ones to look at.

If we're feeling fancy we could even feed those reads directly into the "visualize reads" phase.

2) fix up the bug in visualize-mapping changes as it stands now (it appears to have 
something to do with trying to make an svg on a read with no mapping position. Filter 
those out, or simply make an empty svg with a fitting name? Something like that.)
